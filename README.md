# Calculator
In this project I'm gonna build a calculator that will be operated in the browser. This is the last project of Fundamentals in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator), so I will be applying everything I learned in this course so far, that is HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## [LIVE PREVIEW](https://bast1ann.github.io/calculator/)

## Objectives
* Apply new concepts on Objects.
* The calculator can make basic operations as add, substract, divide and multiply.
* The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.
* Can operate with decimals.
